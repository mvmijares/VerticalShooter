BulletML for Unity
==================

**BulletML for Unity** is a _simple and powerful wrapper_ around the BulletML library. **It requires Unity 5.0 or higher.**

It allows you to design some very complex bullet patterns with a simple XML file. It's especially useful in "Shoot'Em Up" games to create memorable boss fights or enemies.

## Demo

Check [our demo][demo] (including a showcase and a boss fight) to try the plugin.

## Version

Current version is 1.4. Only available on the Asset Store.

## Main features

- Simple and lightweight. No scripting required (if you don't want to).

This plugin works on all the platforms Unity supports.
